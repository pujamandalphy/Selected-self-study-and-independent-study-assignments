# Selected Self-Study and Independent-Study Assignments
## Note to the Reader

The material in this repository represents work completed as part of self-study and informal coursework. While care has been taken to ensure correctness and clarity, these notes reflect my learning process rather than finalized or polished lecture notes.

 The problems included here are a selected subset of those I attempted and was able to work through and understand; many other problems in the corresponding problem sets were beyond my level at the time.
This repository contains five selected assignments completed as part of my preparation in mathematics and theoretical physics.  
The purpose of uploading these assignments is to provide concrete evidence of my readiness and working knowledge in core subjects that were studied rather than as formally evaluated coursework.
All solutions presented are my own and were worked out as part of self-study and independent preparation.
## Contents

The repository includes assignments from the following areas:

- **Group Theory**  
  Numericals on basics and from books suggested by prof. Durganandini who taught the subject.

- **Topology and differential geometry**  
  Selected problems focusing on foundational topological ideas and related to differential forms. Many of the problems included here were suggested as exercises during lectures or recommended as standard problems for practice, while others were selected independently for deeper understanding. 


- **Classical Field Theory**  
  Assignments covering variational principles, field equations, and geometric formulations of classical fields. Some of the problems are taken directly from problem sheets provided at Prof. David Tong lecture series available online.


- **Quantum Field Theory (Quantization of Fields)**  
  Worked problems involving canonical quantization and operator formalism. Some of the problems are taken directly from problem sheets provided at Prof. David Tong lecture series available online.


- **Algebraic structures in QFT**  
   Some of the problems are taken directly from problem sheets provided at Prof. David Tong lecture series available online.

## Notes on Format

All assignments are **handwritten and provided as scanned copies**.  
While care has been taken to keep the solutions clear and logically structured, some parts may be difficult to read due to handwriting.

I plan to **gradually typeset selected assignments in LaTeX** and upload the formatted versions as time permits.



This repository is a living collection and will be updated as additional material is completed or reformatted.
